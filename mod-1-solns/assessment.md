## What is the difference between a CLASS attribute and an ID attribute?
In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

## What is an HTML attribute?
An HTML attribute is a characteristic or property of a element used in a HTML document.
It is content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in different ways from providing information to changing styling.

## What is considered a container by Flexbox?
A container is any element that contains one or more elements within int.

## What is the CSS box model?

## What are the four different components of the box model?
Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear 
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent

## What is the default display of most HTML elements?
The default display is either block or inline

## What does display:block mean?
It means it displays an element in a block. 
It starts on a new line and takes up the whole width by default.

## What does display:flex mean?
A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).

## What does display:inline mean?
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Inline element have a box that wraps tightly around their content only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not require a new line after each element. Inline element can't be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.

## Do you apply "display:flex" on a container element or a child element?
container element

## What is considered a child element in Flexbox?
Once you’ve turned a parent element into a flex container, the direct children of that element become flex children. 
The elements within the container element are the child elements.
